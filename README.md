# FancyConsoleCalculatorApp

This is a simple, for education practice Calculator app via the Console in C#
nothing fancy about it, I've been learning Switch statements and other things, and figured this was my best bet to try them out
other than that, it simply takes two numbers and does one of 4 functions with them, it was done in a custom method to practice that

learning C#? feel free to steal it.
Chances are I will be making a more advanced version of this down the line when I get a bit better, I wanna upload my mini side projects as a progession 
system to help me keep track of my progess!
